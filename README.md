# Number-Guessing-Game
The Number Guessing Game is an interactive web-based game where users are tasked with guessing a randomly generated number between 1 and 10. The game provides instant feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, and it keeps track of how many attempts the user makes until they successfully guess the number.
